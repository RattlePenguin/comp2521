# Introduction
Welcome to COMP2521, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)!
DSA covers a large variety of techniques and knowledge required to store, manipulate and utilise data efficiently.
For some of you, this may be the most fun/interesting/useful course in your career :smiley:

This repository will contain most if not all of what I teach in tutorials, with the exception of whiteboard drawings or external tools such as visualisers.

In previous terms, I would recap lecture content for the first half of the tutorial.
I am moving on from this style and will instead opt for more open-ended tutorials so that I can focus on problems that you all have more trouble with.
As such, please _watch the lectures_ before coming to class.

# Prerequisites

# FAQ
### Are there any group projects?

For labs, optionally yes. For assignments, no.  

### What is the late penalty?

Labs, quizzes and assignments will be penalised by 0.2\% per hour or part thereof.
The penalty is deducted off the attained mark.
After 5 days, submissions are no longer accepted.

### Is there class participation / attendance?

No.

### Can I go to other tutorials?

Yes.

### I'm stuck, where can I get help?

For starters, try searching your problem online.
90% of the time, someone on R\*ddit has already encountered this problem and you will find a solution.
This is an important skill that you should develop.

If you require specialised help, search the forum first then make a post.

Finally, you can email me...

### How does lab marking work?

Labs may either have an automarked component, a handmarked component, or both.
_EVERY_ component must be submitted online by the due date shown in the lab spec.

For the automarked component, an autograder will run your code through tests which will decide your score.

The handmarked component must be marked by me or our lab assistant in person.
This can be done within three weeks of the release week (e.g. Week 1 - Week 3).
We will usually ask you to explain your solution, followed by some short questions.

For example, the week 1 lab is due Monday 12pm, week 2.
The automarked component must be submitted by this time.
The handmarked component can be marked up till Friday, week 3.

You cannot get labs marked in HELP sessions.

### What's your favourite colour!?
