# FAQ
### Are there any group projects?

For labs, optionally yes. For assignments, no.  

### What is the late penalty?

Labs, quizzes and assignments will be penalised by 0.2\% per hour or part thereof.
The penalty is deducted off the attained mark.
After 5 days, submissions are no longer accepted.

### Is there class participation / attendance?

No.

### Can I go to other tutorials?

Yes.

### I'm stuck, where can I get help?
For starters, try searching your problem online. 90% of the time, someone on Reddit has already encountered this problem and you will find a solution. This is the #1 skill that you should develop as a developer / engineer!

If you require specialised help, search the forum and make a post. Forum posts are regularly monitored.

Finally, you can email me...

### How does lab marking work?

Labs may either have an automarked component, a handmarked component, or both.

The automarked component must be submitted online by the due date shown in the lab spec, after which late penalties apply.
An autograder will then run your code through tests which will decide your score.

The handmarked component is due up to three weeks from the week it was assigned.
This must be marked by me or our lab assistant in person.
We will usually ask you to explain your solution, followed by some short questions.

For example, the week 1 lab is due Monday 12pm, week 2. The automarked component must be submitted by this time. The handmarked component can be marked up till Friday, week 3.

You cannot get labs marked in HELP sessions.
