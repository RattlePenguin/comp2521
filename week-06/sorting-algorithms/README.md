# Save Ben
Ben has fallen extremely ill and needs you to find a cure as quickly as possible!!!
You call over a doctor and open a cabinet that contains a immense number of medicines, for example:

["amoxicillin", "crestor", "tygacil", ...a lot more..., "aviane", "gliscor", "rayquaza"]

Unfortunately, the doctor has bad memory and can only tell you which medicine he needs next. How can you fetch each medicine as efficiently as possible?

# Tree Sort
Implement treeSort.c, a program that sorts an array of integers using a binary search tree.

Example:
```
./treeSort
Enter number of integers: 5
Enter each integer (separated by spaces): 5 4 3 2 1
Sorted: 1 2 3 4 5
```
