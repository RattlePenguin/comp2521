How are some people so good with graphs?  
Idk, they just have an edge.

Graphs are just another data structure like linked lists and trees. They are slightly more complicated, so it's best if spend a bit more time on them to get comfortable.

There are three implementations of graphs to learn:
- Adjacency Matrix (2D Array)
- Adjacency List (Array of Lists)
- Array of Edges

Exercises
- For each implementation, create a function to determine whether an edge exists between two nodes.
