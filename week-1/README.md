# Introduction
If you're not good at handling pointers yet, there's no better time than RIGHTNOW!!!

You should dynamically allocate memory when:
- Handling large amounts of memory.
- You need it to live outside of scope.
- Storing user input (sometimes).

You can do so with `malloc` or `calloc` from the C standard library.

Recursion is not just calling the same function in itself.

Why do we sometimes use `struct list` in addition to `struct node`?
