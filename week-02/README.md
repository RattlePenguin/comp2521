# Introduction
At this point, you should be pretty comfortable handling recursive problems and writing solutions.


For this course, there are about 7 sorting algorithms excluding variations. As such, I recommend that you eventually memorise all of them to save lots of time in the final exam.
Trust that this is very easy if you regularly come back and take a look at each one.
